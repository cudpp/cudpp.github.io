CUDPP release 2.0 is a major new release of the CUDPP library, with exciting new features. The public interface has undergone a minor redesign to provide thread safety. Parallel reductions (cudppReduce) and a tridiagonal system solver (cudppTridiagonal) have been added, and a new component library, cudpp_hash, provides fast data-parallel hash table functionality. In addition, support for 64-bit data types (double as well as long long and unsigned long long) has been added to all CUDPP algorithms, and a variety of bugs have been fixed.

For a complete list of changes, see the [change log](http://cudpp.googlecode.com/svn/tags/2.0/doc/html/changelog.html).
