<h2>CUDA Data Parallel Primitives Library</h2>

<p>CUDPP is a library of data-parallel algorithm primitives such as parallel prefix-sum (&ldquo;scan$rdquo;), parallel sort, and parallel reduction. Primitives such as these are important building blocks for a wide variety of data-parallel algorithms, including sorting, stream compaction, and building data structures such as trees and summed-area tables. CUDPP runs on processors that support CUDA.</p>
